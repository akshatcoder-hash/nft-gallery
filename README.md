Having public data stored on the blockchain doesn't make it easily accessible. Querying the blockchain is in fact one of the biggest lifts for developers that will need to start from the origin of the chain to gather the data they need to connect the dots and answer their questions.  Let's say a developer wants to answer the following question: "What NFTs does a wallet own?".  This sounds like a simple inquiry, but the answer is far from easy.  In this case, the developer would need to find all the NFTs minted on a given chain, and then follow all the transfer functions to understand who's currently owning the NFTs.  This task could take developers weeks. Luckily though, there's a solution - with a free Alchemy account and the Alchemy NFT API, that allows devs to fetch NFTs from the blockchain in milliseconds, not weeks.  Because Alchemy has already queried the full blockchain and indexed its data, the NFT API enables you to have full access to the information.
